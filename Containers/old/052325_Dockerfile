# --- R Package Installation ---
# Now, we will install everything from source using install.packages.
# No need for install2.r or explicit .libPaths() as we're building from scratch.

# Install 'remotes' first
RUN R -e "install.packages('remotes', repos = 'https://cloud.r-project.org', type = 'source')"

# Explicitly install 'Matrix' first. This is still crucial.
# Because we are starting with a very minimal R environment, this should
# correctly install the latest Matrix and place it where R expects it.
RUN R -e "install.packages('Matrix', repos = 'https://cloud.r-project.org', type = 'source')"

# Install SeuratObject v5 directly from GitHub
RUN R -e "remotes::install_github('satijalab/seurat-object', ref = 'master', build_vignettes = FALSE, build = FALSE)"

# Install Seurat v5 directly from GitHub's 'seurat5' branch
RUN R -e "remotes::install_github('satijalab/seurat', ref = 'seurat5', build_vignettes = FALSE, build = FALSE)"

# **NEW STEP: Install 'muon' package from CRAN for h5ad conversion**
#RUN R -e "install.packages('muon', repos = 'https://cloud.r-project.org', type = 'source', dependencies = TRUE)"

# Install MuDataSeurat from GitHub
#RUN R -e "remotes::install_github('PMBio/MuDataSeurat', build_vignettes = FALSE, build = FALSE)"

# --- Final Touches ---
# Set default working directory
WORKDIR /data

# Default CMD - You'll likely run an R script for the conversion
CMD ["R"]
